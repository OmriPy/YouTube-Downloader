# YouTube-Downloader

Before I start, I'm sorry for those who are irritated that I didn't use this:
```py
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
I just didn't really care about that but from now on I think I'll use it.
## Preparation
In order for the code to work properly, open Command Prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (macOS) and type these lines:
```
pip3 install pytube
```
This command simply downloads the Pytube module.
